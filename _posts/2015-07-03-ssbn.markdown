description: Served as a Lead Computer Scientist for the development of the U.S. Navy Trident nuclear missile launch and mission control system.  The Trident missile is a submarine-launched ballistic missile which launches from a moving underwater platform, flies into space, guides itself by the stars, and lands multiple free-falling warheads with pinpoint accuracy.  I wrote launch and mission control software, and managed the group that delivered embedded computing infrastructure for the system.
